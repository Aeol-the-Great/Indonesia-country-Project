# Jetset Glamour: Airport Run

A 16-bit inspired web adventure where you play as an influencer navigating a luxury aircraft.

## 🚀 How to Run

There are two easy ways to play the game:

### 1. Locally (Simple)
Simply find the **`index.html`** file in your folder and **double-click it**. It will open in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

### 2. Using a Local Server (Recommended for development)
If you have VS Code, you can use the **Live Server** extension. 
1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Click "Go Live" at the bottom right of the window.

## 🕹️ Controls
*   **W / Up Arrow**: Move Up / Strut forward
*   **S / Down Arrow**: Move Down / Walk back
*   **A / Left Arrow**: Move Left
*   **D / Right Arrow**: Move Right

## 🎯 Objective
Strut down the aisle and find your first-class seat, or navigate to the **cyan exit door** on the left wall to head to the airport gate.

## 📂 GitHub Compatibility
This project is structured to be "plug and play" for GitHub. 
*   **GitHub Pages**: You can host this for free by uploading these files to a GitHub repository and enabling **GitHub Pages** in the repository settings.
*   **Relative Paths**: All assets (images, CSS, JS) use relative paths, so the game will work perfectly regardless of the URL.
